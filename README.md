# Project SortList

## Description
This is my project called **SortList**. It is a Go-based program that allows users to input a list of numbers, choose the sorting order (ascending or descending), and outputs the sorted list. The program is designed to be simple, interactive, and flexible for various use cases.

## Features
- Accepts user input for a list of numbers.
- Allows sorting in ascending or descending order based on user preference.
- Implements a reusable sorting function for flexibility.

3. Choose the sorting order by typing `yes` for ascending or `no` for descending:
   ```
   Sort in ascending order? (yes/no):
   yes
   ```
